## ABOUT

I am an **AI Engineer at Enforce (BTG Pactual Group)**, working on the design and operation of **production-grade intelligent systems** in highly regulated, data-intensive environments.

My work focuses on **AI engineering as a systems discipline**: combining backend engineering, cloud-native platforms, and applied AI to deliver reliable, observable, and governable solutions. I design architectures that move safely from experimentation to production, with explicit attention to validation, risk reduction, and long-term maintainability.

Previously, I served as **Principal Software Engineer at Arte Arena**, leading the development of complex software platforms and AI-driven systems. Earlier in my career, I built strong foundations as a **Software Engineer** in enterprise and institutional contexts, including **Stefanini (allocated at FAPESP)**, **Global Hitss**, and **NPL Brasil**.

In parallel, I am the **Founder and CEO of RBX Robótica**, an AI-first company focused on automation, intelligent systems, and applied AI products, including open-source initiatives.

I hold **Italian (EU) citizenship**, ensuring legal professional eligibility within the European Union.
