### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hi, I’m Leandro Damasio - Full Stack Developer
  
- 👀 I currently work as a Senior Developer Analyst at the Stefanini Group. I am allocated to Fapesp - São Paulo State Research Support Foundation.

- 🌱 I have a master's degree from FGV in Public Administration. I also studied Philosophy at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. And I currently have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Virtual University of the State of São Paulo.

- 💞️ I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects and find other developers with the same interest, as I'm the creator of an open source project called Robson Bot and would love to find people interested in joining me in this endeavor.
