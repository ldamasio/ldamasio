### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hello, I'm Leandro Damasio - Italian-Brazilian, born on Carnival Tuesday in 1986, Full Stack Developer with proficiency in Python and Javascript, with extensive experience in Linux, Django, Node and React.
  
- 👀 I currently work as a Senior Developer Analyst at the Stefanini Group. I am allocated to Fapesp - São Paulo State Research Support Foundation.

- 🌱 I studied Philosophy at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. I was a student leader and was the founder and first president of the National Federation of Public Administration Students, on July 8, 2007. I have a master's degree from FGV in Public Administration. And I currently have a bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering from the Virtual University of the State of São Paulo.

- 💞️ I am a supporter of Free Software. I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects and find other developers with the same interest, as I'm the creator of an open source project called Robson Bot and would love to find people interested in joining me in this endeavor.
