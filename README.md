AI Engineer • Full-Stack Software & Platform Engineer • Technical Lead  
São Paulo, Brazil • Open to remote/global opportunities

## ABOUT

I am an **AI Engineer at Enforce (BTG Pactual Group)**, designing and building AI-first platforms that deliver real-world outcomes across financial and legal domains. My work focuses on blending rigorous engineering discipline with modern AI systems — from agentic workflows and evaluation pipelines to scalable backend and cloud-native infrastructure. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}

Previously, I served as **Principal Software Engineer at Arte Arena**, where I led the development of complex distributed systems and AI-powered platforms. Prior to that, I built foundational experience across multiple enterprise environments as:

- **Senior Software Engineer — Stefanini / FAPESP**  
- **Software Engineer — Global Hitss**  
- **Software Engineer — NPL Brasil** :contentReference[oaicite:4]{index=4}

I am also the **Founder and CEO of RBX Robótica**, an engineering-first company pushing the boundary of automation and intelligent software systems — including the open-source **Robson Bot** repository.
