## About Me

### Hi there 👋

- 👋 Hello, I'm Leandro Damasio - Italian-Brazilian, born on Carnival Tuesday in 1986, Full Stack Developer with proficiency in Python and Javascript, with extensive experience in technologies such as Linux, Django, Node and React.
  
- 👀 Producing improvements in web environments with Django and Apache Solr, I currently work as a Senior Developer Analyst at the Stefanini Group allocated to Fapesp - São Paulo State Research Support Foundation - after going through many experiences and various government bodies, third sector entities and startups.

- 🌱 I studied Philosophy at the Federal University of Santa Catarina. As a student leader, I was co-founder of the National Federation of Public Administration Students, on July 8, 2007. I was also Director of Science and Technology at the Santa Catarina Student Union. I have a master's degree from FGV in Public Administration. And I'm currently studying Computer Engineering at the Virtual University of the State of São Paulo.

- 💞️ I am a supporter of Free Software. I'm looking to collaborate on open source projects and find other developers with the same interest, as I'm the creator of an open source project called [Robson Bot](https://github.com/ldamasio/robson) and would love to find people interested in joining me in this endeavor.
